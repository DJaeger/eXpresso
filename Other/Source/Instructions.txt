eXpresso Instructions

While active, eXpresso allows the user to associate files to applications on a portable device such as
a USB flash drive or an iPod in disk mode, with a standard double click. No permanent modifications
will be made to the host system.

To add an association, make sure eXpresso is running, and double click on a file. If eXpresso does
not yet have an association for that filetype, it will then display a window asking which app you wish
to associate it with. For apps in the PortableApps Format, the filetype should be associated with the
launcher, not the base app.

All associations are recorded as relative paths in an ini file in the eXpresso directory. Therefore,
eXpresso is completely portable and can be considered stealth as well.

Right-clicking the eXpresso system tray icon will open a menu. As an alternative, you can press
Win+Alt, then right click anywhere. From here, you can access the instructions (this file), a copy of
the license, and graphical interfaces to add and modify all of eXpresso's settings
